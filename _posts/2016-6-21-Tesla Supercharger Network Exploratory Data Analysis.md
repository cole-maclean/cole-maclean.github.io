<h2>Introduction</h2>

With the recent unveiling of Tesla's Model 3 and pre-orders approaching 400,000, the internet has been buzzing with Tesla discussions and analysis. One of Tesla's key differentiators from other mass market Electric Vehicals (EVs) is its Super Charger (SC) network that provides 170 miles of range in 30 minutes [source.](https://www.teslamotors.com/supercharger) With Elon Musk stating plans to double the size of the SC network by the end of 2017, a large amount of planning, resources and investment are being allocated to this network expansion.

An analysis exploring Tesla's Supercharger network was performed using [beaker notebooks](http://beakernotebook.com/) and is currently the top rated notebook published on the platform.
