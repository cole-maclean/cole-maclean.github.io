  <h1>
Introduction
</h1>

<p>The Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) industry has exploded in popularity in
recent years, largely due to the exponential growth of users playing on
industry titans such as Fanduel and DraftKings. These platforms allow
users to gamble real money by selecting a set of players known as a
roster from a sport, with rules constraining the total salary and
specific player position types required for a selected roster.Each
player in the roster can accumulate points based on their performance in
the sport in the upcoming game that day.The user then enters this roster
into contests against other users who have also entered their rosters,
with the aim of selecting the roster that accumulates the most points
based on the competitions set rule for point accumulation. The user or
subset of users with the top accumulated points at the end of the
competition win the pot of money entered by each user in the
competition. With the large amount of data now available for multiple
sports, and a platform to utilize that data on, this analysis attempts
to explore the potential predictive parameters available in generating a
successful roster for DFS competitions with the ultimate aim to project
roster points and select the optimal roster for a given competition. The
analysis is constrained to MLB competitions on Fanduel.</p>

<h2>
Data Structure and Sources
</h2>

<p>Data that will be used in this analysis comes from 3 sources:</p>

<ol>
<li> Historical baseball game and player data -
<a href="https://erikberg.com/api">XMLStats</a><br></li>
<li> Historical team lineup data - <a href="http://www.baseballpress.com/lineups">Baseball
Press</a></li>
<li> Historical Weather Data -
<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api">Wunderground</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The data from the above sources has been munged and combined to produce
a structured data set for each player. The structures are split into two
categories representing the two major player types of baseball
competitions: batters and pitchers.Both batter and pitcher data is
organized into a data frame of the following structure:</p>

<p>[Player GameID Player Stats Weather_Data Lineup_Data]</p>

<p>Player and GameID makeup the unique data key for each record of the data
frame</p>

<p>Player Stats data are individual data frame columns of each stat for the
player (ie. homeruns and hits for batters, era and strikeouts for
pitchers)</p>

<p>Weather data contains a dataframe column &quot;wunderground_forecast&quot; that
contains a dictionarty of {&#39;wind&#39;: {&#39;wind_speed&#39;: 1.53, &#39;wind_dir&#39;:
206.67}, &#39;temp&#39;: 72.67, &#39;humidity&#39;: 19.33}</p>

<p>LineupData contains 2 dataframe columns home_starting_lineup and
away_starting_lineups both of with contain dictionaries of {u&#39;Hyun-Jin
Ryu_batter&#39;: {&#39;batting_order&#39;: &#39;9&#39;, &#39;arm&#39;: u&#39;R&#39;} for each player in
the starting lineup.</p>

<h2>
Initial Investigation Plan
</h2>

<p>The initial instinct is to jump right into combining various parameters,
plotting there relationships and reviewing their plots. However, a
clearer definition of the goal is required to better frame the direction
and good questions to ask of the Exploratory Data Analysis of the MLB
player dataset. The Fanduel scoring rules use the following functions to
calculate each players score:</p>

<p>batters_FD_points =
singlesx1+doublesx2+triplesx3+home_runsx4+rbix1+runsx1+walksx1+stolen_basesx1+hit_by_pitchx1+(at_bats-hits])x-.25</p>

<p>pitcher_FD_points =
winx4+earned_runsx-1+strike_outsx1+innings_pitchedx1</p>

<p>Knowing this, there seems to be 2 approaches one could take in
attempting to develop a predictive model for projected player points:<br>
1. Develop an analog function of fanduel scoring rules that attempts to
directly estimate projected player points with the models own internal
parameters.<br>
2. Develop a model that projects the predicted value for each of the
parameters in the fanduel player point function and plugging them into
the function to calculate a players projected points.</p>

<p>Knowing that the ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model and that
in doing so will require a choice between the above 2 options, this
analysis will help provide an exploration and give guidance on pathways
to begin developing the model with.</p>

<p>We will first explore the univariate distributions of fanduel points,
batter and pitcher data and observe any interesting features in the
plots. We will then explore bivariate datasets to discover relationships
between parameters with a focus on their impact on fanduel points.
Lastly, we will further combine parameters into multivariable datasets
and try to discover any interacting relationships across parameters.
Using the patterns and relationships discovered in this analysis will
inform the development of a predictive model.</p>

Univarate Parameter Analysis

Player Fanduel Points

## Standard Deviation =  4.733862
</code></pre></div>
<p>For batters, the distribution of FD_points seems to follow a decaying
distribution, while pitchers FD_points seem to be somewhat normally
distributed with a longer positive tail.This right-side-scew in the
batters distribution is quantified with the large distance between the
median and 3rd quartiles compared to the 1st quartile. The 1st quartile
is only 1/5th of a standard deviation from the median, whereas the 3rd
quartile is 1/3rd of a standard deviation from the median. Compared to
the more normally distributed pitchers distribution, where the 1st
quartile and 3rd quartile are 1/5th and 1/4th of a standard deviation
from the median respectively, quantifies it as being closer to a normal
distribution with a longer right-side tail. A repeating pattern in the
batter distribution that has a local maximum is likely due to the biases
created in the scaling of the batters scoring function. This information
might help in deciding to round model outputs to the discrete possible
ouputs of the scoring function. For both batters and pitchers, there is
a large number of 0 valued FD_points due to the inclusion of players
that did not participate in a game. This will need to be considered as
the dataset is explored further.</p>

<h2>
Batters
</h2>

<p><img src="/img/uni_batter_hist-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The first observation from the above plots is the obvious discrete and
and low-variability nature of the data for many player stats. This
observation makes logical sense, as the game of baseball is made up of
many rules framed around discrete events. A player can run to only 1 of
4 bases, plate appearances are scheduled in the lineup order and there
is a limited subset of events that can occur in any one plate
appearance. There are some parameters, such as total bases, plate
appearances and the more advanced stats obp, slg, and ops that have a
less discrete nature and may warrant further exploration.</p>

<h2>
Pitchers
</h2>

<p><img src="/img/uni_pitcher_hist-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Many of the pitchers stats show the same characteristic of batters in
the discrete and low-variability nature. The pitching stats count and
strikes have interesting double hump distributions that may be
attributed to a select few pitchers that usually pitch a full 8 or 9
innings.</p>

<p>The discrete nature of the parameters that are used in the Fanduel
scoring functions leads me to believe it will be difficult to accurately
develop a model based on predicting each individual input parameter. For
example, the difference between 0 and 2 runs is small, but the impact on
point projections and ultimately selecting the optimum roster could be
large. The distribution of FD_points more readily lends itself to
regression analysis, suggesting that developing an analog function
predicting player fanduel points may produce better results than
directly predicting the input parameters. Alternatively, it may be
possible to develop a hybrid of the two options, using classification of
the discrete inputs as features in the regression model.</p>

<h1>
Bivarate Parameter Analysis
</h1>

<p>We know that the player statistics included in fanduel&#39;s scoring
function will have a linear relationship with fanduel points, as
dictated by the form of fanduel&#39;s scoring equations. For example,
batters rbi&#39;s and pitchers strikeouts. Code adapted from
<a href="http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Scatterplots_(ggplot2)">R-Cookbook</a></p>

<p><img src="/img/bi_batter-1.png" alt=""></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">## r2 =  0.9910313
</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="/img/bi_batter-2.png" alt=""></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">## r2 =  0.9967708
</code></pre></div>
<p>The strong linear relationships, with r2&#39;s of 0.99 for both rbi and
strike_outs is obvious and not very informative, as the linear
relationship of these parameters is built into the fanduel scoring
equations, and by definition are linear relationships of fanduel points.
As was discussed above, it will likely be difficult to accurately
predict the individual parameters in fanduel&#39;s point function. What is
of more interest will be the relationships between the more advanced
player statistics and FD points.</p>

<h2>
Advanced Stats
</h2>

<h3>
Batters
</h3>

<p><img src="/img/bi_batter_adv-1.png" alt=""></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">## r2 =  0.7054033
</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="/img/bi_batter_adv-2.png" alt=""></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">## r2 =  0.7736614
</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="/img/bi_batter_adv-3.png" alt=""></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">## r2 =  0.7834183
</code></pre></div>
<p>It appears the advanced stats for batters may be following a more
quadratic or exponential relationship then linear, with the linear
regression r2 values being 0.70, 0.77 and 0.78 for obp,slg and ops
respectively. I had originally guessed the relationships would have very
strong linear relationships with r2&#39;s closer to 1, so it is good to
discover something counter thesis to my intuition in this data
exploration. The fact that the relationships seem quite similar is
expected, as the advanced stats are closely related.</p>

<p>Cleaning up some of the outliers and applying a regression to the
batters slg vs FD_points stats seems like a good candidate for closer
inspection in the more detailed section of this analysis.</p>

<h3>
Pitchers
</h3>

<p><img src="/img/bi_pitcher_adv-1.png" alt=""></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">## r2 =  0.07168485
</code></pre></div>
<p>The only advanced stat for pitchers in this dataset is their WHIP. A
clear pattern is hard to determine from this plot, with a potential
linear or logarithmic relationship that has a strong clustering in the
bottom left quadrant of the graph. The low rsquared linear regression
value of 0.07 shows that building a linear model with the WHIP parameter
in it&#39;s current state will not be very useful, and other data
transformations may be required. The large variation in the scatter of
this relationship may mean that whip will not provide usable information
in creating a predictive model, but it may be possible to combine whip
with another feature to give it stronger predictive power. One option
could be to find the characteristic(s) of a pitcher that causes him to
cluster into the lower left quadrant of this plot. We could then run a
clustering classifier on pitchers, that produces as a result the pitcher
either does or doesn&#39;t clump into the lower left quadrant. If he does,
we assign him a default prediction value (ie the mean of the cluster).
If he doesn&#39;t, we can then apply the linear/logarithmic function as a
prediction for the players that do not seem to cluster. This will
require further exploration in the modelling stage.</p>

<h2>
Weather
</h2>

<p>As some MLB baseball diamonds are outdoors, the weather may have an
impact on player performance. The below plots investigate temperature
and humidity for batters and pitchers. Wind will be investigated in the
multi-variate analysis, as direction and speed will come into play. The
decode_wg_weather utility function is used to parse out open air
stadiums only and decode the wunderground weather json data.</p>

<h3>
Batters
</h3>

<p><img src="/img/bi_batter_weather-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This plot is clearly not very useful, but does show that the wundeground
weather temperature data contains some wonky data with large negative
values seen in the dataset. Cleaning up these outliers and 0 valued
temps and moving to box plots:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">batter_data.OD.decoded$bin_temp &lt;- cut(batter_data.OD.decoded$temp,
                                       c(25,35,45,55,65,75,85,95,105))
temp_groups &lt;- group_by(batter_data.OD.decoded,bin_temp)
batter_data.temp_meds &lt;- summarize(temp_groups,
                                   FD_points_median = median(FD_points))
ggplot(batter_data.OD.decoded, aes(x=bin_temp, y=FD_points)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 10)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_text(data = batter_data.temp_meds,
            aes(x = bin_temp, y = FD_points_median,
            label = FD_points_median), 
            size = 3, vjust = -1.5)
</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="/img/bi_batter_temp-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult to say if temperature has any affect at all on a batters
FD points, with median values being quite similar across all temperature
bins. There may be a slightly quadratic relationship with the median
values being higher at the cold and hot edges of the temperature
distribution, but further work will be required to prove if this is
useful for the predictive model.</p>

<p><img src="/img/bi_batter_humd-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Again, humidity seems to have very low impact on a batters FD_points
with median values being very similar across all humidity bins and no
desernable pattern in the boxplots.</p>

<h3>
Pitchers
</h3>

<p>Pitchers may be more affected by weather then batters.
<img src="/img/bi_pitcher_temp-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>With a median of 2 FD_points for all temp bins, the lack of a clear
trend in FD_points vs temp for pitchers matches what was seen for
batters and does not seem to be very as a predictive parameter.</p>

<p><img src="/img/bi_pitcher_humd-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Humidity also seems to provide little predictive power for pitchers
FD_points, with medians of 2 persisting in each humidity bin.</p>

<p>It does not appear that weather (temp and humidity) have a very big
impact on a MLB players FD_points. This data may be useful to create a
classifier that determines if a game will be rained out, as selecting
players from a postponed game will greatly affect the roster performance
(ie. selected a player that ends up with 0 FD_points) and may need to
be explored further during model development.</p>

<h1>
Multi-Variate Analysis
</h1>

<p>There may exist interactions between parameters that reveal interesting
relationships we can take advantage of for model development.</p>

<h2>
Wind
</h2>

<p>The first multi-variate parameter investigated will be the impact of
wind speed and direction on players FD_points. The function
wind_spiral_plots is defined to parse the data into 6 windspeed bins,
calculate the mean FD_points for each wind_angle per windspeed bin and
plots the spiral plot of angle vs mean FD_points for all 6 windspeed
bins. There likely exists a more elegant solution then the current
functions code, but the functionality is adequate. I&#39;ll need to sharpen
my R coding skills and come back to refactor this function at a later
date.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">#Function to parse dataframe wind data and 
#create spiral plots based on wind angle and FD_points.
wind_spiral_plot &lt;-function(df){
  wind_speed_bins = c(-Inf,4,6,8,10,12,Inf) 
  df$bin_wind_speed = cut(df$wind_speed,wind_speed_bins) #Bin wind speeds
  df.wind_speed_groups = split(df,f=df$bin_wind_speed)
  wind_df = data.frame()
  #Loop through each wind speed dataframe
  for(i in 1:length(df.wind_speed_groups)) 
    {
      wind_dir_groups &lt;- with(df.wind_speed_groups[[i]],
                      cut(wind_dir,c(0,25,50,75,100,125,150,175,
                                     200,225,250,275,300,325,359),
                          include.lowest = TRUE))
    dat &lt;- aggregate(FD_points ~ wind_dir_groups,
                     data = df.wind_speed_groups[[i]], FUN = mean)
                    #Summarize FD_points per wind angle
    dat$wind_speed_group_indx = wind_speed_bins[i]
    wind_df&lt;-rbind(wind_df,dat)
    }
  return (ggplot(wind_df,aes(x = wind_dir_groups, y = FD_points)) + 
      geom_bar(stat='identity') + coord_polar(start = 0) +
      facet_wrap(~wind_speed_group_indx))
}
</code></pre></div>
<h3>
Batters
</h3>

<p><img src="/img/batter_wind-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There appears to be some effect of wind speed and direction on batters
fanduel points that may prove useful as a feature for model development.
Some wind speeds seem to have spikes in FD_points in the upper left
quadrant, while others show spikes at many angles. More work will need
to be done to prove the significant of a relationship, as well a doing a
more detailed investigation to analyze the effect of wind for individual
ballparks. This will be looked at in the more detailed section of this
analysis.</p>

<h3>
Pitchers
</h3>

<p><img src="/img/pitcher_wind-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Pitchers do not seem to be as affected by wind speed and direction as
batters, with few obvious spikes or variations in FD_points at
different speeds and angles. Wind data may not prove to be an
informative parameter for the predictive model, but a more granular
investigation at a per ballpark level should be conducted.</p>

<h1>
Detailed Plots and Analysis
</h1>

<p>Three plots have been identified that warrant further investigation:<br>
1. Batter FD_points vs SLG to test regression models<br>
2. Pitcher FD_points vs WHIP to better identify clustering and trend in
the relationship<br>
3. Batter wind data spiral plots to better understand the significance
and strength of the effect wind has on batter performance</p>

<h2>
Batter FD\_point vs SLG
</h2>

<p>Batter FD_points vs SLG was chosen in the final plots section as it
displayed a potentially quadratic or exponential relationship, that if
properly defined, could prove useful in building a predictive model.</p>

<p>The cleaned up version of batter FD_points vs SLG plot shows that the
initial impression of a highly quadratic or exponential relationship may
not have been accurate. The R2 for a linear model is nearly identical to
that of a quadratic, with an exponential regression being the worst r2
of the models. More advance outlier cleaning techniques may be required
during model development.</p>

<h2>
Pitcher FD\_points vs WHIP
</h2>

<p>Pitcher FD_points vs WHIP was chosen to include in the final plots
section, as WHIP is currently the only advanced stat for pitchers in the
dataset and showed an interesting distribution in the scatterplot, that
if properly classified into clusters could provide useful for grouping
pitchers into fanduel point ranges for use in a predictive model.</p>

<p><img src="/img/final_whip-1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Cleaning up the pitcher WHIP data for outliers and plotting the results
magnifies the clustering that occurs at the lower left of the dataset,
and also shows a possible logarithmic trend for data points outside the
cluster. It may be possible for the model to develop a automated cluster
classification and apply a logarithmic regression to pitchers that fall
outside this cluster as part of the predictive model.</p>

<h2>
Batter Wind Effects
</h2>

<p>Batter wind effects were chosen for inclusion in the final plots section
as some variation in fanduel points vs windspeed and direction were seen
in the plots. This advanced relationship could prove to be an edge in
predictive models over competing models that not account for the
potential wind relationship in predicting batter fanduel points.</p>

<p>Utilizing the wind_spiral_plot function defined earlier and refining:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">wind_spiral_plot_formatted &lt;-function(df){
  wind_spiral_plot(df) +
  aes(fill=wind_speed_group_indx) + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Wind Speed m/s")) + 
  ggtitle("Batter Fanduel points vs Wind speed and Direction") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c("(75,100]","(150,175]","(275,300]",
                            "(325,359]"),
                   labels=c("(75,100]"="75","(150,175]"="150",
                                             "(275,300]"="275",
                                             "(325,359]"="325")) +
  theme(strip.background = element_blank(),strip.text.x = element_blank()) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Fanduel Points")
}
wind_spiral_plot_formatted(batter_data.OD.decoded)
</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="/img/final_wind-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<p>There are some large outliers in FD_points at windspeeds of 2m/s, 10m/s
and 12m/s, which may prove useful in a predictive model.Further analysis
is needed to explore each ballpark and it may be beneficial to normalize
the dataset to ballpark homeplate direction, but the inclusion of wind
as an advanced parameter in the predictive model may prove to be an
advantage of simpler competing models.</p>

<h1>
Reflection
</h1>

<p>Being a dynamic sport, with so many variables and events, parsing and
exploring the MLB dataset proved both challenging an insightful. The
biggest challenges in this analysis included manipulating data from
multiple sources and formats, and coercing that data into useful and
interpretable visualizations. Coming up with an idea of a beautiful plot
is the easy part; mangling the data and actually building the plot takes
effort and many iterations to obtain a refined product. Two specific
challenges included unraveling the json wunderground weather dataset
into usable data for plotting. This took some advanced R decoding
functions and long hours of debugging multiple errors. Another challenge
was in learning R-programming syntax in general, especially ggplot2 use
cases. Many hours were spent goggling different methods in attempts to
create the plots shown above, and many others not shown that did not
produce the expected result. After a lot of trial and error, successful
methods of generating the desired plots were found. As the analysis
progressed, the number of trials before success decreased, as I began to
get a more intuitive understanding of the R and ggplot2 syntax. The
ability to continuously add layers to a plot is very cool, and I&#39;m
especially proud of the wind_spiral_plot_formatted which takes the
returned ggplot of the wind_spiral_plot and expands on it to refine
the plot. I can imagine there being a lot of interesting use cases with
this kind of functionality.</p>

<p>This analysis provides many useful insights for a starting point to
develop a predictive model. It provided support in the decision to
develop an analog model of FD_points instead of attempting to predict
the FD scoring function inputs directly. It showed both advanced stats
and wind for batters seem informative, and displayed paths that may not
be valuable to pursue, such as wind parameters for pitchers. Being as
dynamic as it is, there are many, many more parameters and relationships
to be explored for building a MLB FD_points predictive model. The most
obvious omission in the above analysis is its lack of investigation into
the impact of oppositional teams on a players FD_points. For example,
exploring a batters points vs a low WHIP pitcher, or a pitchers points
versus a high scoring team. These relationships will need to be explored
before a optimal predictive model can be develop, but will require
further data munging to align the dataset for that sort of analysis.
That will likely be the subject of a future analysis.</p>
